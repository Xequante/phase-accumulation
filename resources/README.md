# Resources Folder

This is a folder for storing any data that I want to use for the project.

The main data that I store in resources is a folder neural_nets, which I use to store 
all of the neural networks that I generate.  This folder is included in the .gitignore,
as this project generates numerous NNs, which is too much data to include in the git.
